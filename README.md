# Wavezone
wavezone code current version
go forward/backward
turn left/right
top speed to be dertermined
no turning without throttle/speed command
limit the maximum turning angle to about 30 degrees by limiting right/left wheel speed differences
absolute speed is determined by the throttle, turing doesn't change the absolute speed
